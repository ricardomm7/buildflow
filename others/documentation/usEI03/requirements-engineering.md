# USEI03 - Calculate the total production time for the items.

## Requirements Engineering

### A) User Story Description

> Calculate the total production time for the items.

### B) Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> The system should be able to calculate the total production time for each item, taking into account the sequence of 
> operations that must be performed. Each operation is associated with a specific machine or station, and the time to 
> execute the operation can vary depending on the machine used.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Ah?
>
> **Answer:** No.


### C) Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The system must calculate the total production time for an item based on the sum of all required operationsâ€™ durations.
* **AC2:** The calculation must consider the sequential order of operations specified for each item.
* **AC3:** The result should be displayed clearly, showing the total time for each item.


### D) Found out Dependencies

* This functionality depends on having accurate data about the operations required for each item and the time taken for each operation.

* It relies on data from the Bill of Operations (BOO) for the correct sequence and duration of operations.

### E) Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * csv file names

* Selected data:
    * none

**Output Data:**

* The total production time for the item (in minutes or hours, as applicable).

### F) Other Relevant Remarks

* Implement appropriate permissions and access controls to restrict the ability to register a skill to authorized HRM users only.

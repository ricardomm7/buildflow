## Design - User Story Realization 

### A) Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...   | Answer                | Justification (with patterns)                                                                                 |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1  		     | 	... interacting with the actor?              | CreateSkillUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

* ZZZ
* UUU
* WWW
